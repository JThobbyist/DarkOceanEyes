Problem Specification
Summary:
We need a computer system for our boat which will do a variety of tasks. This spec will just specifiy we need a cpu. The cpu must
be able to process lots of data b/w our cameras and our hard disks. The cpu will have to also constantly be reevaluating the direction of the boat
and ensure that it is following along its correct path. The boat will need to keep track of certain data such as errors. It will need to respond
to communication i.e. I/O from our command center. I am not sure what temperature range the boat will be in and how hot it may get, but that is
a factor as well. Lastly there will be interesting energy issues especially if we choose our power source to be batteries and solar panels. We must
also be aware of how much interference and electromagnetic interference. How long can the cpu run consistenly and reliably.
