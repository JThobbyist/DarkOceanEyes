#Engineering an ocean faring vessel
The first goal of this project is to create an ocean faring vessel that can video and spend great lengths of time on the ocean.
The goal of this is to travel all the oceans on the surface. We should get video from the whole surface of the ocean. We are going to stick
with the Atlantic Ocean. Once we successfully traverse the Atlantic ocean, can traverse other oceans.

Each the phases will take the engineering problem of creating a cheap, autonomous ocean-faring vessel and break it up into more manageable
engineering problems. (this is the general direction and of course, issues will pop up.

The current plan of order of dealing with issues is:
1. Computer System- What chip, motherboard, I/O hardware modules, memory, hard disks will we use? How can we interface with the boat w/o opening it?
2. Navigation system- What will be used to navigate?
3. Camera system- How will we record video? What quality?
4. Telemetry, Command and control system
5. Propeller system
6. Energy storage system
7. Energy source system
8. Hull design- What kind of hull design? How will we open up the boat and interface or repair?
9. Total construction
10. Improvements
