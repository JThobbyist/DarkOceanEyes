#Our Process:
We work in small iterations with fast feedback. This process is cyclical, so each phase ends with a release of our product.
A great learning from computer science is we try to deal with problems really small and ideally try to solve one hard problem
at a time. The brain can only keep so much information in working memory at once.

-- These steps should get us closer to our goal of completing the current phase.

##Step 1: Write out problem requirements

##Step 2: Write out technical specification

##Step 3: Break up work into tickets to implement

##Step 4: Implementation

##Step 5: Feedback
