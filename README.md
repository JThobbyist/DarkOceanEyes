We are a designing unmanned autonomous vehicles to video every cubic kilometer of the ocean. We want to get a wide array of people like you
to help cooperate and achieve this challening goal.

##The Problem
Ocean explortation has been slow and expensive. The lack of innovation, and imagination has been sad. The ocean has been overshadowed by space.
There are so many interesting creatures that offer life saving medicines. There are so many creatures that are undiscovered, and may die before
we discover them (luckily we can at least get them on camera) due to our polluting of the ocean and climate change. If we can at least get them
on camera we can have a better understanding of solution. Since so much of the ocean has been unexplored we have a very poor understanding of human
impact on ocean. Oceanograpy and marine biology, we hypothesize is a very incomplete science because so little of the ocean is explored. The other
issue is we don't see much innovation in the UAVs, so much of our society has been information technology innovation and not much innovation in
atoms. We want to get scientists, engineers, artists, and enthusiasts excited about the ocean. It is unacceptable that in 2021 so much of the ocean
is unknown to us, yet we have landed a man on the moon and many rovers millions of miles away on mars.

##Why us?
If we didn't tackle this issue, would someone else? We found the answer to be a resounding no! Yes, there are organizations that are making
nice progress with ocean explortation, but we find this progress to be slow and uninspiring.
